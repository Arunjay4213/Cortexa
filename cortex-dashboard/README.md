## 🎯 One Sentence

**CortexOS is an observability layer for AI agent memory.** It sits between any memory system and the LLM, tells you which memories influenced each response, what they cost, and whether they helped or hurt.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd cortex-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## 💡 The Problem

### **Five Critical Failures in Production AI:**

| Problem | Impact | CortexOS Solution |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 🔴 **Token Bleed** | 30-40% wasted, $38K/year per 50 agents | Identify low-impact memories, optimize retrieval |
| 🔴 **Hallucinations** | 30-60 min debugging per incident | 3-second root-cause tracing with Shapley attribution |
| 🔴 **Degradation** | Silent quality decay over months | Proactive contradiction alerts at write-time |
| 🔴 **Compliance** | Can't prove GDPR deletion chains | Complete provenance graph + audit trail |
| 🔴 **Configuration** | Guessing retrieval parameters | A/B testing with live projections |

**Key Insight:** We don't replace memory systems. We wrap them like a profiler wraps a database.

## 🎮 Demo Walkthroughs

### **1. Memory Flow Demo** (/memory-flow)

**Click "START DEMO" for automated 8-second walkthrough:**

| Step | Time | What You See |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1. Query** | 1.5s | User asks: "When does my subscription renew?" |
| **2. Retrieval** | 1.5s | 6 memories fetched, 682 tokens, 8.2ms latency |
| **3. Attribution** | 2s | Shapley bars show M001 has 73% influence |
| **4. Diagnosis** | 2.5s | **HALLUCINATION:** Agent says "March 15th" but subscription was cancelled Feb 1st |

**Root Cause Found:** Memory M001 (stale, "renews monthly") has 73% Shapley, Memory M198 (correct, "cancelled Feb 1") has only 12% and is underranked.

**Impact:** $360/day from 45 similar hallucinations

**Interactions:**
- ✅ Click any memory → See detailed breakdown
- ✅ Click "View Provenance Chain" → GDPR deletion modal
- ✅ Token economics shows 42% waste ($105/day recoverable)

### **2. Cockpit Demo** (/cockpit) 🔥

**Real scenario: Healthcare ops engineer fixes medication hallucination**

#### **7 Operational Modes:**

##### **Overview - Drag-and-Drop Tiers**
- 3 colored zones: HOT (red), WARM (yellow), COLD (blue)
- Drag memories between tiers
- **Try it:** Drag non-critical memory → ✅ Success alert
- **Try it:** Drag critical memory (🛡️) out of HOT → ❌ Error!

##### **Live Editor**
- Select memory → Edit content
- See BEFORE/AFTER comparison in real-time
- Shows impact preview (affected responses, token cost)

##### **Optimizer** 🎛️
- **3 sliders:**
  - Retrieval K (3-15 memories per query)
  - Recency Weight (0-1, favor recent)
  - Safety Boost (1x-3x, critical memory priority)
- **Live projections:** Accuracy & cost update as you drag
- **A/B test:** Click "RUN A/B TEST" for side-by-side comparison
- **Assessment:** "✓ OPTIMAL" or "✗ POOR TRADEOFF"

##### **Contradiction Resolver** 🚨
- **Pulsing RED alert:** "MEDICATION CONTRADICTION - 247 responses affected"
- Side-by-side: Warfarin (stale, 82% influence) vs Eliquis (current, 8% influence)
- Click "APPLY RESOLUTION" → One-click fix
- Re-evaluates 247 responses automatically

##### **Blast Radius Calculator**
- Shows how many responses each memory affects
- Color-coded: Red (>100), Yellow (50-100), Green (<50)
- Total: "356 responses need re-evaluation"

##### **Audit Trail**
- Timestamped log of all operations
- User attribution for compliance
- "EXPORT REPORT" button for regulators

## 🔧 What's Real vs Demo

### ✅ **Technically Feasible (90% of features):**

| Feature | Implementation | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Shapley Attribution** | Train lightweight model on exact labels, <10ms inference | ✅ Proven (Data Shapley paper, 2019) |
| **Hallucination Detection** | DeBERTa-NLI model, 85-90% accuracy | ✅ Off-the-shelf |
| **Contradiction Detection** | NLI + temporal classifier at write-time | ✅ Standard NLP |
| **Token Tracking** | Count tokens, multiply by price | ✅ Trivial |
| **Memory Lifecycle** | Rules-based archival with safety pins | ✅ Standard practice |
| **GDPR Provenance** | Database foreign keys + recursive delete | ✅ Standard SQL |
| **Blast Radius** | Query logs indexed by memory_id | ✅ Analytics |

### ⚠️ **Demo Estimates (10% of features):**

| Feature | Current | Production |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **A/B Testing Accuracy** | Formula-based projection | Run shadow traffic, measure real impact |
| **Impact Preview** | Estimated until re-run | Re-run subset of queries for true numbers |

**Honest Pitch:**
- ✅ Say: "Shapley attribution is proven—we train a lightweight model on exact values"
- ✅ Say: "Hallucination detection uses DeBERTa-NLI with 85% accuracy"
- ⚠️ Say: "These projections are estimates—production validates with shadow traffic"

## 🎬 3-Minute Pitch Script

**Slide 1: Problem** (30s)
"Every AI agent has memory now. Mem0 raised $24M. Zep, EverMemOS—memory is standard. But nobody knows what memory is doing. When an agent hallucinates, debugging is: scroll through 100s of memories, guess which one caused it."

**Slide 2: Demo - Memory Flow** (90s)
1. Click "START DEMO" at /memory-flow
2. "User asks about subscription. System retrieves 6 memories, 682 tokens."
3. "Our Shapley attribution: This stale memory has 73% influence."
4. "Agent hallucinates. We trace root cause in 3 seconds—not 30 minutes."
5. "Click here—GDPR provenance shows complete deletion chain."

**Slide 3: Demo - Cockpit** (45s)
1. Open /cockpit → "RED alert: medication contradiction affecting 247 responses"
2. "Drag memories between tiers. Critical memories locked for safety."
3. "Click 'Resolver' → One-click fix. Complete audit trail for compliance."

**Slide 4: The Analogy** (15s)
"Bloomberg didn't invent stocks. It made every position in your portfolio legible—cost, return, risk. We do the same for AI memory."

## 🤝 Competitive Landscape

| Company | What They Do | Gap CortexOS Fills |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Mem0** | Store & retrieve memories | No attribution, no health metrics, no compliance |
| **Zep** | Temporal knowledge graph | Can't explain causality, no optimization |
| **EverMemOS** | 93% LoCoMo benchmark | Can't explain *why*, no provenance |

**Key:** We wrap them, don't replace them. Different category (observability vs storage).
